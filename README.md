The goal is to make manualy a drupal entity "MyProfile",
and then create a custom form to comunicate with The database tabel "MyProfile"


Issues:
-I have no problems  running  "lando drush cr" wich is good, but when i query myprofile table with "lando drush sql-query "SELECT * FROM myprofile".
i get the following error "  Query failed. Rerun with --debug to see any error message. ERROR 1146 (42S02) at line 1: Table 'drupal8.myprofile' doesn't exist "
